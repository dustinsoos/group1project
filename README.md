This was a group project in class creating a user friendly interface

My group and I decided to come up with a easy to navigate place that you can look at our art.

We used main stream famous art pictures as an example, but we wanted to create something that you could use to portray your own art on a website.

We were all given tasks to complete and my portion was the contact form which is attached with a picture below. Hope you enjoy! I used HTML/CSS/and some Javascript for this project with a custom design.
